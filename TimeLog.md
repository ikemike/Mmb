|4/14/16| DAO, Hibernate progress | 3 | Trying to get as far as I can in the next two weeks. I Fixed directory structures, project settings and made significant progress towards integrating my database |
|4/16/16| DAO, Hibernate, Unit Testing | 4 | IT WORKS! Using hibernate to create new database entries is up and running. Created
unit tests for the User |
|4/17/16| User Log in | 1 | Setting up user roles |
|4/18/16| User Log in, Website design, Arduino configuration | 4 | Index.jsp has a link to the test log in page. Very basic Authentication
now works and user role Administrator is configured. Spent a lot of time configuring the Mindflex headsets to save the .csv data
they display. Tried a program called "Gobetwino" which was able to capture data from the arduino's serial port as long as it was sending data.
Saving that data though proved be a severe challenge. I ended up going with another program, called "CoolTerm" that
reads the data and saves it as a text file. The next challenge is going to be displaying it. |
