# Time Log
|Date|Task|Hours|Notes|
|----|----|-----|-----|
|2/10/16| Project Directory setup | 2.5| Review week 1-2, week 3 |
|2/12/16| Mindflex headset hacking | 4 | Research |
|2/13/16| Mindflex headset hacking | 2 | Research, issue with raspberry pi and serial data. |
|2/14/16| Mindflex headset hacking | 3 | Arduino bought, configuration overview |
|2/15/16| Arduino libraries and setup | .5 | Arduino IDE installed, library research |
|2/16/16| Arduino brain library | .5 | Configuration of the publicly available "Brain Library" for Arduino |
|2/17/16| Script testing, development | 1 | Configuration of Brain Library, troubleshooting IDE compatibility issues |
|2/23/16| WSDL | .5 | Didn't get very far, will need to revisit |
|2/25|16| Script Testing | 2 | Brain Library - Fixed some compatibility issues |
|3/01/16| Script Testing | 2 | Finally resolved compatibility issues, visualizing csv data works! |
|3/05/16| Data Visualization | 1 | Started researching ways to display my data on the web |
|3/08/16| Data Storage | 1 | Spent a small amount of time trying to plan out database storage of my data |
|3/??/16| Website development | 2 | Attended night class, spent time building out my index.jsp |
|3/??/16| Website development | 2 | Checked out Pinegrow HTML design editor |
|4/14/16| DAO, Hibernate progress | 3 | Trying to get as far as I can in the next two weeks. <br>I Fixed directory structures, project settings and made significant progress towards integrating my database |
|4/16/16| DAO, Hibernate, Unit Testing | 4 | IT WORKS! Using hibernate to create new database entries is up and running. <br>Created unit tests for the User |
|4/17/16| User Log in | 1 | Setting up user roles |
|4/18/16| Log in, Web design, Arduino config | 4.5 | Index.jsp has a link to the test log in page. <br>Very basic Authentication now works and user role Administrator is configured. <br>Spent a lot of time configuring the Mindflex headsets to save the .csv data they display.<br>Tried a program called "Gobetwino" which was able to capture data from the arduino's serial port as long as it was sending data.<br>Saving that data proved be a severe challenge. I ended up going with another program, called "CoolTerm" that reads the data and<br>saves it as a text file. The next challenge is going to be displaying it. A jquery plugin called JQuery-CSV may be my solution. |
|4/20/16| Web Design | 4 | High level design of website |
|4/26/16| Web | 1 | Index.jsp changed |
|4/28/16| Code review changes | 1 | Index.jsp changes made |
|5/03/16| Logging serial data | 2 | Investigated other ways of making data transmission between the arduino and my website easier.<br> ThingSpeak had a lot of potential, but updates once every 15 seconds will not work. |
|5/05/16| Logging serial data | .5 | Feel like I'm getting a lot closer here to saving data from the headsets - Just more research right now |
|5/07/16| Serial Storage DAO | 4 | Serial data is available to be parsed & stored. BrainDao created for data storage. BrainDaoTest created for record testing |
|5/08/16| Serial Storage DAO | 3 | Data storage, hibernate |
|5/09/16| Site Design, Data storage | 10 | Pulled an all-nighter to get the project presentation ready. |
|5/10/16| Presentation preparation | 6 | Continuing on from Monday, I needed to transport my code & database from my desktop to laptop. |
|5/11/16| Final plans | 1 | Documentation, servlet fixup, best buy API attempt |
|5/12/16| Final push | 5 | Tried to get a basic API implementation to meet requirements, add properties access, documentation, openshift. |
