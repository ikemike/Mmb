Map My Brain is a simple website that hosts live brain data from an arduino powered EEG headset.
To log your own brain data, you'll need the following:
1.) A Neurosky brand EEG headset.
2.) An Arduino that features at least one hardware serial port.
3.) The Arduino IDE brain library, available at: https://github.com/kitschpatrol/Brain.
4.) A serial port terminal application - I recommend CoolTerm
If you'd like to give the project a shot, Frontier Nerds,
an IT DIY blogger, has a perfect description of how to dismantle the headset
and set up the Arduino brain library sketch. http://www.frontiernerds.com/brain-hack
